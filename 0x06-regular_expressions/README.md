# 0x06. Regular expression


## Overview
Welcome to my Regex project! In this assignment, I've created Ruby scripts that use regular expressions (regex) with the Oniguruma library. These scripts solve various tasks that involve regex pattern matching.


## Concepts
In this project, I've explored the concept of **Regular Expressions** and applied it to practical problem-solving.

## How to Use
To run any of the tasks, simply execute the corresponding Ruby script in your terminal. For example:

```bash
./0-simply_match_school.rb "Best School"
```

This will execute the script for Task 0.

## Project Structure
- **Task Files:** You'll find individual Ruby scripts for each task in this repository.
- **Resources:** I've used online resources, including tutorials and interactive exercises, to better understand and apply regular expressions.

## Tasks
I've completed the following tasks in this project:

1. [Task 0: Simply Matching School](0-simply_match_school.rb)
- Requirements:
  - The regular expression must match the word "School."
  - Create a Ruby script that accepts one argument and passes it to a regular expression matching method.
  
2. [Task 1: Repetition Token #0](1-repetition_token_0.rb)
- Requirements:
  - Find the regular expression that will match specified cases.
  - Create a Ruby script to implement the regular expression.

3. [Task 2: Repetition Token #1](2-repetition_token_1.rb)
- Requirements:
  - Find the regular expression that will match specified cases.
  - Create a Ruby script to implement the regular expression.

4. [Task 3: Repetition Token #2](3-repetition_token_2.rb)
- Requirements:
  - Find the regular expression that will match specified cases.
  - Create a Ruby script to implement the regular expression.

5. [Task 4: Repetition Token #3](4-repetition_token_3.rb)
- Requirements:
  - Find the regular expression that will match specified cases (without square brackets).
  - Create a Ruby script to implement the regular expression.

6. [Task 5: Not Quite HBTN Yet](5-beginning_and_end.rb)
- Requirements:
  - The regular expression must exactly match a string that starts with "h," ends with "n," and can have any single character in between.

7. [Task 6: Call Me Maybe](6-phone_number.rb)
- Requirements:
  - The regular expression must match a 10-digit phone number.

8. [Task 7: OMG WHY ARE YOU SHOUTING?](7-OMG_WHY_ARE_YOU_SHOUTING.rb)
- Requirements:
  - The regular expression must only match capital letters.

9. [Task 8: TextMe (Advanced)](100-textme.rb)
- Requirements:
  - Create a Ruby script to parse log data and extract sender, receiver, and flags information.
