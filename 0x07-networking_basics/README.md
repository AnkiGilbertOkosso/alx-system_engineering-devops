# Networking Basics #0 

## Overview
Welcome to Networking Basics #0! This project is a deep dive into fundamental networking concepts. By completing these tasks, I've gained valuable knowledge about network models, types of networks, MAC and IP addresses, protocols, and more.


## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, I can confidently explain the following networking concepts without needing external assistance:

- OSI Model and its layered structure
- Distinctions between LAN and WAN, including usage and geographical scope
- The role of IP addresses, both MAC and IP, and their types
- The purpose of localhost and subnets
- The rationale behind IPv6 adoption
- The contrast between TCP and UDP protocols
- The significance of ports, with a focus on SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS
- Using ping and ICMP for network connectivity checks

## Requirements
To ensure project success, I've adhered to these requirements:

- Editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Bash scripts executed on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- All files end with a new line
- A mandatory README.md file at the project root
- Bash script files are executable and pass shellcheck
- All Bash scripts start with `#!/usr/bin/env bash` and include explanatory comments

## Project Structure
This project comprises several tasks, each addressing a specific networking topic:

1. **OSI model**
    - What is the OSI model?
    - How is the OSI model organized?

2. **Types of network**
    - What type of network is a local computer connected to?
    - What network connects offices in different buildings?

3. **MAC and IP address**
    - What is a MAC address?
    - What is an IP address?

4. **TCP and UDP**
    - Describe TCP and UDP using the provided diagram.

5. **TCP and UDP ports**
   - Write a Bash script to display listening ports, including PID and program names.

6. **Is the host on the network**
   - Write a Bash script to ping an IP address passed as an argument.


## Usage
Detailed instructions for executing each task can be found in their respective task files within this directory.
